I think I’ve seen it somewhere, this spoiler
An endless loop of roller coaster Oh yeah
Exit that can’t be reached even if I try to reach out
I think I’m lost

Find me in the pieces of your unbreakable dreams
Put me together, when I scatter, I’ll fade and disappear

But all I got is bad bad bad idea
I’m afraid, this bad bad dream comes real
I’m afraid I’ll miss out on you calling me
But all I got is bad bad bad idea
When this space is filled with your voice looking for me
My world is changing
Keep calling me, don’t stop any more
Wake me up, bad bad bad idea (Hey)

It fades little by little Like fade out
I don’t think I can escape Oh yeah
Whether I’m awake or it’s a dream
I don’t seem to know anymore

Find me, when I scatter, I’ll fade and disappear
But all I got is bad bad bad idea
I’m afraid, this bad bad dream comes real
I’m afraid I’ll miss out on you calling me
But all I got is bad bad bad idea
When this space is filled with your voice looking for me
My world is changing
Keep calling me, don’t stop any more
Wake me up, bad bad bad idea (Hey)
(Woo) The space your voice draws
(Woo) The moment I followed the map
(Woo) Find the light that illuminates you
It shines, it becomes clear and big

But all I got is bad bad bad idea
I’m afraid, this bad bad dream comes real
I’m afraid I’ll miss out on you calling me
But all I got is bad bad bad idea
Little by little, as if a sense of being locked awakes
I am dyed with you
Keep calling me, don’t stop any more
Wake me up Make make make it real
Wake me up Make make make it real...
